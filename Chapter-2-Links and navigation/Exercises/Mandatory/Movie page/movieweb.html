    <li> &#128100; <strong>Ellen</strong> says:Honestly wish I liked this movie. Unfortunately it tries to be a hero and address every single present day social issue and in my opinion, strays too far from the original books.</li>
    <li> &#128100;<strong>Mark</strong> says:This is an adaptation based on the books; not a retelling of the books themselves. The show is well written although the first season is by far the best in my opinion</li>
    <li> &#128100; <strong>Josie</strong> says:I Would 100% recommend!!!</li>
    <li> &#128100; <strong>Shrub</strong> says:My mother and I loved the origin series Anne of Greengables, so I thought I would enjoy this remake. I was very disappointed to see it</li>
