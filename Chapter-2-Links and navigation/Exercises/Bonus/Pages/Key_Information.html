Although Diana doesn’t mistreat Anne as the others do, she becomes a silent bystander, which in modern viewers’ eyes makes her as guilty as the bullies. Meanwhile, Anne’s teacher Mr. Phillips is borderline sadistic. He doesn’t acknowledge or respect Anne’s academic prowess. Instead, he regularly humiliates her in front of the class.
