<h2 id="Reviews">Reviews &#128490; :</h2>
<ul type="none">
<li> &#128100; <strong>Genn</strong> says:Yes this show does not follow the book but I strongly recommend this show!!</li>
<li> &#128100; <strong>Ellen</strong> says:Honestly wish I liked this movie. Unfortunately it tries to be a hero and address every single present day social issue and in my opinion, strays too far from the original books.</li>
<li> &#128100;<strong>Mark</strong> says:This is an adaptation based on the books; not a retelling of the books themselves. The show is well written although the first season is by far the best in my opinion</li>
<li> &#128100; <strong>Josie</strong> says:I Would 100% recommend!!!</li>
<li> &#128100; <strong>Shrub</strong> says:My mother and I loved the origin series Anne of Greengables, so I thought I would enjoy this remake. I was very disappointed to see it</li>
<li> &#128100; <strong>Brookeschafer</strong> says:I felt so strongly about the content we viewed that I had to say something. Long and short, find and old version to watch. This is a terrible reimagining</li>
<li> &#128100; <strong>Rea of green gables</strong>Not at all like the classic... I am very disappointed</li>
<li> &#128100; <strong>Ruth Genn</strong>Yes this show does not follow the book but it is amazing. My 9 year old daughter and I watch it together, and it’s a great way to discuss themes like growing up, friendship, being different and different kinds of families.</li>
<li> &#128100; <strong>SB1978</strong> No, thanks.
I'm all for adaptations, but this classic story was not honored here. Anne is not meant to be dark or edgy - it's beyond disappointing, it's ridiculous.</li>
<li> &#128100; <strong>Sarah.C</strong>A fabulous heartfelt show for old spirits and those who are outsiders; timeless themes.
Watching this, I'll eagerly show this to my child in a few more years, and I've recommended this to other families. </li>
